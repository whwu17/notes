Colors make changes in visual effects. This post collected and excerpted all Pantone color trends from the past decade, where they can be used as fundamental colors for flat/graphic design and creative collections for all materials such as magazines and plane material. The color wheel on the cover (clockwised) is a gradient from these past popular colors in decades, showcasing the transitions on color and the conversion over the decade and consequently reflecting the colors' changes over the time.

不同的颜色在视觉效果上有着显著的差别。以下我们整理了近十年的Pantone色彩流行趋势，可以用于日常的页面设计基础色轮，以及期刊创意素材。封面上的色轮（顺时针方向）是这十种流行色的拼合，借以这种方式展示不同年间的色彩过渡与变化，反映出色彩随时间而变化的效果。

Note: In fact, the color trend is obtained from flat printing. Therefore, unlike colors shown in monitors, all these color might have slight differences in different color gamuts (like RGB, CMYK and so on). Therefore, the actual color selection should be based on the color of the physical medium - paper. All colors on the screen are only the approximate colors under the RGB color gamuts. For the real color coordinates, you can find the exact values based on the Pantone color system in Adobe Stock and get (with charged only) the corresponding color coordinations.

注意：实际上，该色彩流行趋势是以平面印刷为出发点得到的。因此，与显示器色彩不同，该颜色在不同色域（RGB、CMYK等）中都存在细微的差异。因此，颜色的真实选取应以纸张颜色呈现为标准。屏幕中的所有颜色均是在RGB框架下的近似颜色。有关真实的颜色坐标，可在Adobe Stock中检查Pantone色系中的准确数值，并获取（付费的）其对应的色彩信息。

This more unilateral approach to color is coinciding with societal movements toward gender equality and fluidity, the consumer's increased comfort with using color as a form of expression, a generation that has less concern about being typecast or judged and an open exchange of digital information that has opened our eyes to different approaches to color usage.
